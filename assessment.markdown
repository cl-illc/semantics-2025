Here you will find the criteria used in assessing your final reports. 

Your conference-style report will be assessed by two independent reviewers according to the following evaluation criteria.

You get points for the following:

* Scope (max 2 points): *Is the problem well presented? Do students understand the challenges/contributions?* Here we expected to learn about:
    * is the problem, namely, *learning general purpose sentence representations*, formulated and its relevance discussed clearly? (1 point) 
    * do students discuss what's expected out of the analysis (e.g. *assessing the role of context in embedding models*) (1 point)
* Theoretical description (max 3 points): *Are the models presented clearly and correctly?* Here we expected to learn about:
    * skip-gram (1 point): discriminative, context independent embeddings, linear composition function
    * embed-align (1 point): generative, context sensitive, multilingual
    * benchmark (1 point): linear classifiers whose features are pre-trained embeddings, composition function (typically average), cross-validation. 
* Empirical evaluation (max 5 points): *Is the experimental setup sound/convincing? Are experimental findings presented in an organised and effective manner?* Here we expected to learn about:
    * is the data and tasks described correctly (1 point)
    * are the results compatible with what is expected for skip-gram pre-trained on the provided data? (1 point)
    * are the results compatible with what is expected for the pre-trained embed-align we provided? (1 point)
    * a discussion of findings (1 point): are results discussed and do students relate the differences in performance to aspects of each model (even if as speculation)
    * criticism  (1 point): examples of what to look for 
        * some investigation of hyperparameters of models or benchmark
        * simple qualitative analysis (e.g. cherry-picked examples)
        * plots and figures highlighting an interesting pattern

You lose points for bad writing style (because you were asked to prepare a conference-style report).

* Writing style
    * did not make proper use of the latex template (e.g. tweaked the template): -0.5
    * did not respect the page limit: 1 column is tolerated, beyond that it's -0.5 for the first page, we stop reading beyond that (which will affect your grade for other criteria as well).
    * bad structure (e.g. missing important sections such as introduction and conclusion): -0.5 per section.
    * command of English: judged case by case
